# Image Reversal over Y-Axis

This project provides a simple script to reverse an image over the y-axis using Python and the Pillow (PIL) library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (`pip install Pillow`)

## Usage

To reverse an image:

```bash
python reverse_image.py [path_to_image] [output_path]
```
For example:
```bash
python reverse_image.py input.jpg reversed.jpg
```

## Notes 

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed and that you provide the correct paths to the input image and desired output location.
